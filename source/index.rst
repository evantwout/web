Welcome to BEM++
================

BEM++ is a project to develop a modern open source C++ boundary
element library. It is a joint project between University College
London (UCL), the University of Reading and the University of
Durham. The main coding team is located at UCL and consists of Simon
Arridge, Timo Betcke, Martin Schweiger and Wojciech Smigaj. Other project members include Stephen Langdon (Reading), Douglas Saddy (Reading), and Jon Trevelyan (Durham).

Status
------
The project is still in development but already usable for certain problems. The following features are implemented.

- Galerkin discretization of all standard boundary integral operators
  (single-layer potential, double-layer potential, adjoint double-layer
  potential, hypersingular operator) for Laplace, Helmholtz and modified
  Helmholtz problems in three dimensions.

- Numerical evaluation of boundary-element integrals (singular integrals dealt
  with using Sauter-Schwab quadrature rules).

- Triangular surface mesh handling. Import of meshes in Gmsh format.

- Piecewise constant and continuous piecewise linear basis functions.

- Dense-matrix representation of boundary integral operators supported natively.

- Assembly of H-matrix representations of boundary integral operators via
  adaptive cross approximation (ACA) supported thanks to an interface to
  M. Bebendorfâ€™s `AHMED <http://bebendorf.ins.uni-bonn.de/AHMED.html>`_ library.

- H-matrix-based preconditioners (via AHMED).

- Easy creation of operators composed of several logical blocks.

- Interfaces to iterative linear solvers from Trilinos.

- Evaluation of potentials in space (away from the discretized surface).

- Export of solutions in VTK format.

- Parallel operation on shared-memory CPU architectures.

- C++ and Python interfaces.

Acknowledgements
----------------
The project was made possible by EPSRC Grant EP/I030042/1, which started 01 October 2011 and provides initial funding for two years. Special thanks go also to the members of the `HyENA <http://portal.tugraz.at/portal/page/portal/Files/i2610/files/Forschung/Software/HyENA/html/index.html>`_ Team at TU Graz who gave us permission to use their Galerkin integration routines for BEM++.
