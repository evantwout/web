Welcome to BEM++
================

BEM++ is a project to develop a modern open source C++ boundary
element library. It is a joint project between University College
London (UCL), the University of Reading and the University of
Durham. The main coding team is located at UCL and consists of Simon
Arridge, Timo Betcke, Martin Schweiger and Wojciech Śmigaj. Other project members include Stephen Langdon (Reading), Douglas Saddy (Reading), and Jon Trevelyan (Durham).
