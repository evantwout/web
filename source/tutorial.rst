Tutorial
========

This is a collection of tutorials for BEM++.  There are several books that provide background on
boundary integral equations and boundary element methods.  In these tutorials, we use 
'Numerical Approximation Methods for Elliptic Boundary Value Problems', by Steinbach_, as our reference.
